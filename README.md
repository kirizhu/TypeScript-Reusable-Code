# TypeScript-Reusable-Code

Working with CSV files

First simple implementation

# Load

I use the Filesystem module for this part

# Parse

split on new line
map to array and split on comma

# Analyze

do some simple data massage and get number of wins for a particular team

# Report

print the wins

# Issues with first implementation

# Magic string comparisons 'H', 'A', 'D'

- Solution: Enums

# Source of data is hardcoded

- Breaking out CSV file reader into separate class for more reusable code

# Data array is all strings even though they contain numbers

-

# Variable is named after a specific team

-

# Analysis type is fixed

-

# No ability to output the report in different formats
